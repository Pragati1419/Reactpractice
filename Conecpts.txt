Q.How to Render Multiple Elements inside ReactDOM.render() method in React JS
Ans: In React, we can only render one element. Even if we have multiple elements to render, there can only be a single root element. This means if we want to render two or more elements, 
we have to wrap them in another element or component. Commonly, the element used for this is a div tag.
